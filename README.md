# ABSTRACT
Game development involves creating interactive digital experiences for players to
enjoy. This process includes designing game mechanics, creating characters and
environments, programming code, and testing the game to ensure it functions properly. The
goal of game development is to create an engaging and enjoyable experience that keeps
players coming back for more. The Heist Chronicles is an action-packed first-person shooter
game set in a world of high stakes crime and daring heists. This game offers players an
immersive and thrilling experience, allowing them to step into the shoes of a skilled thief
and embark on a series of high-risk, high-reward missions. The Heist Chronicles challenges
players to plan and execute complex heists, using a variety of weapons and gadgets to
overcome obstacles and outsmart their opponents. Each mission presents a unique set of
challenges and requires careful planning and precise execution to succeed. The Heist
Chronicles offers endless hours of thrilling gameplay and high-octane action.
# INTRODUCTION
The objective of developing The Heist Chronicles is to create an engaging and
realistic bank robbery experience that captivates players and immerses them in a thrilling
gameplay. The challenge lies in designing gameplay mechanics that strikes a balance
between the excitement of heist and the need for strategic planning. Additionally, the game
also offers a visually stunning environment, smooth gameplay mechanics, to keep players
invested in the game.
Heist Chronicles features three action-packed levels, each designed to test your
agility, strategic thinking, and marksmanship. As you progress through the game, the
difficulty intensifies, ensuring an adrenaline-fuelled experience that will keep you on the
edge of your seat.
The Unreal Engine provides a solid foundation for creating realistic environments
and dynamic gameplay mechanics. With Unreal Engine, you can bring amazing real-time
experiences to life using the world’s most advanced real-time 3D creation tool.
To meet these goals, a range of tools and technologies were utilised throughout
the development process. Throughout this project we will explore the problem statement,
proposed system, algorithm implemented and the evaluation of the developed game
# Problem Statement 
The objective of this mini project is to develop a game called The Heist Chronicles
set in the domain of game development. The game aims to provide an engaging and
immersive experience where the player takes on the role of a thief attempting to steal money
from a bank. The problem is to design and implement a game that offers exciting gameplay
mechanics. While ensuring an appropriate balance between challenge and enjoyment for the
player. Additionally, the game incorporates graphics, controls, and an audiovisual experience
to enhance player engagement.
# SCOPE
The scope of the project is a bank robbery game, which uses various aspects
related to gameplay mechanisms where the game will be played from a first-person
perspective, immersing the player in the role of a bank robber. The game aims to provide
player with engaging gameplay and accomplishment as they execute successful heist.
# HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS
The project requires the following hardware components:
• Processor: The processor is a vital component that handles the game's calculations
and instructions. A quad-core Intel processor with a clock speed of 2.5 GHz or faster
ensures that the game runs smoothly and efficiently. The processor's speed and core
count directly impact the game's performance, allowing for seamless gameplay and
quick response times.
• RAM: Random Access Memory (RAM) is crucial for running the game and storing
temporary data. With 8 GB of RAM, the game can load and run various assets,
textures, and scripts without experiencing significant slowdowns. Sufficient RAM
capacity ensures that the game operates smoothly, reduces loading times, and
provides a seamless gaming experience.
• Keyboard: A keyboard is an essential input device for controlling the game. Players
can use the keyboard to navigate through menus, interact with in-game objects, and
execute various actions. The keyboard allows for precise and responsive control,
enabling players to execute their heists with precision and efficiency.
• Mouse: A mouse is another crucial input device that enhances control and precision
in the game. It enables players to aim accurately, perform smooth camera
movements, and interact with the game's user interface. The mouse's sensitivity and
responsiveness contribute to the overall gameplay experience.
• Graphics Card: A graphics card is responsible for rendering the game's visuals,
including characters, environments, and special effects. DirectX 11 or 12
compatibility refers to support for Microsoft's graphics technology, which allows for
advanced rendering techniques, improved performance, and visual fidelity. Metal 1.2
compatibility, on the other hand, refers to Apple's graphics technology, offering
similar benefits on macOS systems. A compatible graphics card ensures that the
game's graphics are rendered smoothly, allowing players to enjoy high-quality
visuals and immersive environments.
# SOFTWARE'S USED
•Epic Games Launcher: The Epic Games Launcher is a digital distribution platform
and game launcher developed by Epic Games. It serves as a central hub for
downloading, installing, and managing games developed using Unreal Engine.
• Unreal Engine 5 (Version – 5.1.1): Unreal Engine 5 is a powerful and widely-used
game development engine developed by Epic Games. It provides a comprehensive
suite of tools, features, and resources for creating high-quality, visually stunning, and
immersive games. The Heist Chronicles was developed using Unreal Engine 5,
leveraging its advanced rendering capabilities, physics simulations, scripting system,
and asset management tools.
• Blender: Blender is a free and open-source 3D modelling, animation, and rendering
software. It is widely used in the game development industry for creating 3D assets,
including characters, environments, and props. In The Heist Chronicles, Blender was
utilised for 3D modelling.
• Adobe Mixamo: Adobe Mixamo is a web-based service that provides a vast library
of 3D character animations.
• Meta Sounds (Unreal Engine): Meta Sounds is a sound design tool and plugin
integrated into Unreal Engine. It provides a powerful audio system for creating and
implementing sound effects, ambient sounds, and music in games. 
# SYSTEM DESIGN
FLOW CHART
Flowcharts were utilised as a visual representation to illustrate the game's design
and mechanics. Flowcharts provide a structured and organised way to depict the flow of
events, decision-making processes, and interactions within the game.
They are particularly useful in game development as they help to convey complex systems
and interactions in a clear and understandable manner. They serve as a blueprint for
understanding the game's logic, progression, and player choices.
